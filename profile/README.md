# Hi there 👋 Welcome to `TCOR` (The City of Robloxia)

## Who we are

We are in charge of the up and coming roblox game called TCOR!

This game has been inspired by the game `The Neighborhood of Robloxia`

This is a refined version of TNOR with more fetures.

We own 100% of our game idea to Q_Q the developer of TNOR...

Our success is 100% beacuse of thier OG game and his work.


## What we have (all of this is plans)
